# Word-Guess-Game

<strong>GT GAMEDAY GUESS!</strong> is an addictive game styled after classic "Hangman" style word guess games, but with the added theme of America's greatest sporting tradition, college football!  Users play as the one of the most tradition rich teams in college football history, the <strong> Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets </strong>!  In the spirit of the theme, the game board is a classic styled jumbotron scoreboard.  The game word the player guesses is Georgia Tech's opponent for each round, which will be the name of a random NCAA Football Championship Subdivision institution.  The game features more than 60 possible opponents, providing hours of continued challenging gameplay.  A player receives 5 guesses each round.  If a player chooses a letter that was already guessed in the round, or enters a key that is not a letter, the referee's whistle will alert the player to choose again.  The player's remaining guesses are represented on the scoreboard in the format of a clock, such that the game clock appears to have 5 seconds remaining (0:05) at the beginning of the round.  With every missed guess, a second comes off the clock so that the player feels the anxiety of time running out, just like in high stakes of a college football game.  If the player guesses the name of the opponent before the guess "clock" expires, Georgia Tech scores a touchdown and is credited with 7 points on the scoreboard.  And just like on Saturdays at Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a Tech touchdown cues the Yellow Jacket Marching Band playing their traditional post touchdown classic "White and Gold" followed by the greatest fight song ever written, "Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech!"  But it isn't all glory.  If the player runs out of guesses before uncovering the name of the opponent, the opponent scores a touchdown, which credits the opponent with 7 points.  And the player better be ready to hear about it from the Bobby Dodd Stadium faithful.  Each touchdown marks the end of the round, after which the player can continue with the current game score against the next opponent by pressing the SPACE bar, or restart the game score and begin from scratch by pressing ESCAPE.  Think you can surpass the score of Georgia Tech's epic all-time college football record setting 222-0 victory over Cumberland College in 1916?  Now is your chance with <strong>GT GAMEDAY GUESS!</strong>  It's your guess!
